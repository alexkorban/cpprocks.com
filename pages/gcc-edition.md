# C++11 Rocks book: GCC edition

You want to write better performing, cleaner code using the latest C++ features. You know that C++11 and C++14 have a lot to offer, but there are so many different changes, and it’s hard to decide where to begin.

Blogs only provide shallow or fragmented descriptions, and wading through 1000’s of pages in books in search of the new features is time consuming. It just seems too difficult.

## What if there was an easy solution?

Imagine if you could get concise, to the point description of **just the new features**. All carefully collected in a single book with tons of code samples. 

## Master all the modern C++ features quickly

I've dedicated hundreds of hours to research so you don't have to. My book is laser-focused on the language changes made in C++11 and implemented by the GCC compiler (versions 4.8.1 and above, which have full C++11 support). 

You’ll get in-depth knowledge required to use the latest C++ features in your projects. The book has tons of examples, detailed explanations, and no fluff.

## Benefits for you and your project

Any non-trivial project will benefit from using the new features. These are the main advantages:

*   Better performance
*   Improved abstractions
*   Less boilerplate code
*   More type safety

## Readers say...

This is a sample of what people had to say about my books:

> **It's exactly what I needed**: I'm a seasoned C++ veterean who's been working with Java since mid-2010. So what I needed is mainly an "in-depth update" on all the new stuff that came with C++ 11, and I don't have the time (or the inclination) to read all through Stroustrup's 4th edition. And your book just fits that bill :-) - _Philipp Leibfried_


> What I like about the C++11 Rocks book is that its relatively short, getting right to the new new C++11 material. Despite this, it includes **just the right amount of background material** in a couple places that really need it. It's a very well balanced book. - _Tony Di Croce_


> I was looking for a good way to get introduced to C++11 - and quickly. **Your book has been very helpful**. Coming from C++03 I both needed a detailed explanation of the new features and also a good insight into the new way of thinking about, and attacking, the problems I was faced with. <br/><br/> I loved the good price and the quick access to the book. I also like the fact the book is still in development and you are active on twitter - it really gives a face to the author. I also dig the idea that it targets subsystems like gcc and Visual Studio. Thanks man! – _Mads Ravn_


> I picked up a copy of Alex's book, and he has done some amazing work! For those of you who find yourself short on time, but need to know what's new and keep current this book has it all. **It's a great time saver**, and the organization of the material makes it a great companion reference. <br/><br/> It covers template changes, the new class features including the changes related to constructors and inheritance, and the changes made for Unicode support and defining custom suffixes in C++11. It also covers concurrency and the use of thread-local variables. I haven't finished it all, but it is **well worth the small investment** for the work he has summarized!! – _Jay D. Campbell_
